# What is Celo?

Celo is a smart contract blockchain network. The technology uses a phone-number-based identity system with address-based encryption and eigentrust-based reputation. Their first application is a social payments system that can be used on a smartphone. 
Celo is preparing to launch a variety of stable coins pegged to global fiat and crypto currencies, the first one being pegged to the US dollar (cUSD).

# Why build on Celo? 
The Celo blockchain is designed to empower anyone with a smartphone anywhere in the world to have access to financial services, send money to phone numbers, and pay merchants. The project aims to be a decentralized platform that is not controlled by any single entity, but instead developed, upgraded and operated by a broad community of individuals, organizations and partners. 
Celo is oriented around providing the simplest possible experience for end users, who may have no familiarity with cryptocurrencies, and may be using low cost devices with limited connectivity. To achieve this, the project takes a full-stack approach, comprising of both a protocol and applications that use that protocol. Celo offers a full suite of powerful features: 
- Stable value currencies (cUSD)
- Accounts linked to phone numbers
- Transaction fees in any currency
- Immediate syncing
- Programmable (full EVM compatibility)
- Carbon Neutral

# What can you build on Celo? 
Celo enables developers to build a new financial system to empower their users. Developers can: 
- Create financial services applications for the underbanked (savings accounts, money transfer interfaces, merchant services, lending, trading)
- Integrate with existing blockchain and traditional financial services
- Create transparent aid services
- Build payroll integrations to allow internet users to earn stable currencies
- Create advanced user wallets (smart contract wallets) 
Alternative currencies 
- Use the full suite of Ethereum smart contracts right off the shelf
